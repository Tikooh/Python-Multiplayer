Modules used:
Socket
Threading

SOCKET:

socket.socket(socket.AF.INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) 
AF_INET is used to specify which address family (IPV4 IPV6 UNIX BLUETOOTH) can be used with the socket.
SOCK_STREAM means it is a TCP socket

server.bind((HOST,PORT))
Any users have to connect to that host and that port 

server.listen(LISTENER_LIMIT)

server.accept() gives two arguments, socket and client address.

threading.Thread(target=client_handler, args=(client, )).start()
Using threading to ensure it runs at the same time as server listening.

username = client.recv(2048).decode('utf-8')
recv = receive maximum size of message = 2048
decode in encoding utf-8

Have a function for listening to messages
All messages must be encoded to send and decoded to receive

client.sendall(message.encode())

FOR DOCKER CONTAINER

FROM debian

WORKDIR /usr/src

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
#installing python

RUN useradd --create-home appuser 
# runs as root user

COPY server.py .
#copies the code to the docker image

ENV API_KEY=testuser
# pass as environment variable used for user authentication

EXPOSE 1234

CMD ["python3", "server.py"]

using sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
after running docker container to see if socket is being used but it isn't
